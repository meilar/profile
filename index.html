    <div class="about section">
      <h2>background</h2>
      <p>My animating passion is for <strong>exploration</strong> and to discover <strong>new connections and patterns</strong> in the world around us. After studying Music History at Reed College, I started working in Portland, Oregon area non-profits, completing successful terms in <strong>administrative and operations</strong> roles at an organization dedicated to youth and family services, then performing arts. In March 2020, I was an <strong>essential part of pivoting</strong> the Portland Baroque Orchestra to an all-digital season, both as part of an administrative team and directly as a <strong>recording assistant and video editor</strong>. In autumn 2021, I left PBO to pursue <strong>more challenging and intellectually stimulating work</strong>. I am pursuing work on the path toward a career change to software and web development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="career section">
      <h2>career change</h2>
      <p>When I was going through high school, it was still a new idea that you could submit school work electronically. One of my teachers still accepted handwritten papers! Facebook arrived on campus sophomore year, and <strong> we all could see that the internet was going to change everything but coding wasn't yet treated as a skill that everyone could learn.</strong> Java was offered as an elective, but only if you had finished calculus. I was not a math loving teenager, and I was never going to make it in the door of a calculus class, let alone finish one. So I never thought that computer programming was a realistic career path.</p>
      <p>In 2019, I took an introductory programming class in Portland, and <strong>that experience opened me up to the idea that I could be successful</strong> as a software or web developer. It took me a couple more years to figure out how to attend a full time learning program. The COVID-19 crisis was the straw that broke the camel's back. My job description was shifting all the time and I was ready to take a big leap into change. <strong>I am very excited to find out what happens next.</strong></p>
