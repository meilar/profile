## About this project
This site was created to fulfill the requirements of my first [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com) code review. I completed a version of this project in 2019 while attending a part-time introductory version of the Epicodus program. That project can be viewed [here, on Github Pages.](https://meilar.github.io/portfolio) (I had more personality back then.)

### Features

## How to view

To view this webpage:

1. Ensure that you have the most recent version of Git installed. [Instructions can be found here.](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

2. Open "index.html" in a CSS3 and HTML5-compliant browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari.

## Technologies Used

This site incorporates the following frameworks and languages:

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap 4.5

The following software tools were used to develop this page:

- VS Code
- Google Chrome
- Git

I created a custom favicon using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io). Custom fonts are served by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). Background texture by [Transparent Textures](https://transparenttextures.com)


## Known Issues

There are no content blocks that are broken. For more polish, the next steps I would take to polish this page are:

- rewrite the "Fun Facts" sidebar to use a columning method that does not break Bootstrap's responsive design.
- the semitransparent layer with text on mouseover on the photos is not the same size as the photo. Untangling how the Bootstrap image styling and the custom code for that mouseover effect interact with each other was beyond me in the time I had. 
- I could not get the background color of the card deck to match the other boxes with secondary color. 
-The badges I created for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap were created in HTML and CSS, and look weird on small viewports. I should recreate those as images.
